## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: your presentation is due tomorrow, but the slides are still blank; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, yet all your enthusiasm is drained by tedious layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult
- 3️⃣ Results look similar, with severe homogenization
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Disjointed text-image layouts with poor design aesthetics

These deficiencies make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to satisfy our dual needs for "speed" and "beauty." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" fall far short of being truly "Vibe" in my eyes.

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. Furthermore, it can accurately render almost all text requested in the prompts while following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Rapidly generate aesthetically pleasing PPTs with zero barrier to entry, requiring no design experience and reducing the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Refer to AI-generated layouts and combinations of text and visual elements to quickly gain design inspiration.
3. **Educators**: Quickly convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Quickly complete presentation assignments, focusing energy on content rather than layout and formatting.
5. **Professionals**: Rapidly visualize business proposals and product introductions with quick adaptation across multiple scenarios.

## **🔧 Frequently Asked Questions**

1. **Garbled or blurry text on generated pages**
    - You can select a higher resolution output (the OpenAI format may not support increasing resolution; using the Gemini format is recommended). Based on testing, adjusting the resolution from 1k to 2k before generating pages significantly improves text rendering quality.
    - Please ensure that the page description includes the specific text content to be rendered.

2. **Poor results when exporting editable PPTs, such as overlapping text or missing styles**
    - In 90% of cases, this is caused by API configuration issues. You can refer to the troubleshooting and solutions in [issue 121](https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides/issues/121).

3. **Is the free tier Gemini API Key supported?**
    - The free tier only supports text generation and does not support image generation.

4. **503 Error or Retry Error occurs during content generation**
    - You can check the Docker backend logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error for the 503 issue. This is generally caused by incorrect model configuration.

5. **Why does the API Key set in .env not take effect?**
    - You need to restart the Docker container after editing the `.env` file to apply the changes.
    - If you have configured parameters on the web settings page, they will override the parameters in the `.env` file. You can revert to the `.env` settings by clicking "Restore Default Settings."
